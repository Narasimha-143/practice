Describing about git and  github
=> Git is a Version Control System(VCS) where we can share the source code and it is a local repository where only one person can work with it in his own system.
=> Git Hub is also a Version Control System similar to Git but there is a slight difference i.e it is a remote repository where multiple people can collaborate 
     with each other 
=> Main purposes of git and git hub is 
     * To share the source code
     * To track the changes that have done day to day
     * Can backtrack to previous version if needed.
     * Bugs and issues can be identified easily and resolve them
     * Git is developed by linux and Git hub is developed by Microsoft.
